      About the Kero Clan Government
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Kero Clan Government consists of the Senate, which makes decisions for the clan, and are also the leaders of the clan.  Members of the Senate propose changes, or amendments, to the clan. A 2/3 vote yes will pass the amendment and the change will be effective, but if not everything will stay the same. Propositions are changes that deal with acceptance into Kero/Kayro Clans and the Senate.
