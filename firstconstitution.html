  <p><b>Preamble:</b> Reason for the Creation of the Government
    We, the founding Senators have decided that to create a more perfect clan, we must establish a written constitution. Our goals are in the interest of maintaining national and individual sovereignty. We the Senators of the Kero Clan, in order to form a more perfect clan, establish fair play, promote Friendly Battles, do protect and establish this Constitution for the Republic of Kero.

    <b>Article II:</b> Formation of the Senate
    Section 1: The Senate must have a minimum of 6 members.

The role of the Senators is to lead the clan, and make decisions.

    Section 2: When engaging in friendly battles, play fairly and use good manners, saying “Good game!”, “Good luck!” and “Well played!!” is great, but spamming the laughing or mad symbols reflect bad sportsmanship, and we want to support a friendly environment. Additionally, these requirements span into real world, where punishments can still be given.

    <b>Article IV:</b> Amending
    Section 1: Amending the Constitution is allowed. Amendments are suggested by members, elders, co-leaders, or the Senate of Kero Clan, and are revised by the Senate of Kero Clan. Once the revision is finished, the Senate has a vote, and a vote of at least ? will make the amendment effective.
