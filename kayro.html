    <h3>Our Feeder Clan, the <i>Kayro Clan</i></h3>
    <p>
      We have created a feeder clan, Kayro Clan for those would like to join our clan but fall short of the trophy requirement, or if there is not enough space. Kayro Clan also offers a less active alternative to the fast-paced Kero Clan.
